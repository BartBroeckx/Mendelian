Mendelian is an R package that can be used to filter sequencing variants. It enables filtering for both dominant and recessive traits, with a wide variety of options (including reduced penetrance and detectance). 

This package can be installed from github using: 
```{r, echo = FALSE}
require(devtools)
devtools::install_github("BartBroeckx/Mendelian", build_vignettes=TRUE)
```

Detailed examples are available in the vignette.
